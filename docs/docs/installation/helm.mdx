# Helm

First, fork the Qdrant Operator repo from
[GitHub](https://github.com/qdrant-operator/qdrant-operator).

The included helm chart contains the necessary permissions and configuration to
run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster.

To install the operator, run the following command:

```bash
helm install qdrant-operator ./charts/qdrant-operator
```
